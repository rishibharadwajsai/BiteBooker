## Reporting a Vulnerability  

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it directly to me.  

1. **Contact**  
   Email me at [rishi.lella123@gmail.com](mailto:rishi.lella123@gmail.com) with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report." Please include:  
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.  
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.  
   - Any relevant logs, screenshots, or additional details.  

2. **Acknowledgment**  
   I will review the report and respond within **48 hours** to confirm receipt and provide an initial assessment.  

3. **Resolution Timeline**  
   As this is a personal project, resolutions will be prioritized based on the severity of the issue and my availability. Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed as soon as possible, while less critical issues may take longer.  

4. **Confidentiality**  
   I request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been resolved. I will credit you for your report if you wish, but this is entirely optional.  

Thank you for helping improve the security of this project!
